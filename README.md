The AI & Drone-Based Afforestation Monitoring System is an intelligent solution designed to monitor, analyze, and evaluate large-scale afforestation and reforestation projects using drone imagery and artificial intelligence.
Traditional ground-based monitoring methods are time-consuming, costly, and often inaccurate. This system bridges that gap by leveraging high-resolution drone images, computer vision, and machine learning models to automatically detect saplings, assess their health status, calculate survival rates, and track plantation growth over time.
The system processes aerial images captured at different time intervals to:

Detect and count planted saplings

Identify alive vs dead plants

Calculate survival percentage

Locate pit centers and plantation patterns

Compare temporal drone images to monitor growth and changes

By automating these tasks, the solution enables data-driven decision-making, improves accountability, and ensures transparent monitoring of afforestation initiatives at scale.

This project is especially useful for:

Government afforestation programs

Environmental NGOs

Forest departments

Smart city and climate-action initiatives

The system is designed to be scalable, cost-effective, and deployable in real-world environments, making it suitable for hackathons, research, and production-level implementations.
